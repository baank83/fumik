# Fumik robot

In August 2021, I got an idea to make a robot be able to draw pictures on a wall. After many days researching, designing, and programming, I finally finished a robot that could draw any pattern on a wall.

My key-point in design is using general parts to make robot, so end-users can easily renew parts if repairing is needed. Body frame, motor, bolts and nuts, â€¦ are all easily found on the market. Main controller is well-known PCB Arduino Mega compatible with CNC Shield to control two stepper motors that allow robot can traverse by belt.

Fumik is now ready for you to hang it on your house wall and start drawing any pictures. You can use Fumik to customize your house with decor picture when you wish; make your house to be special in case of a Christmas, birthday or an anniversary!

Fumik is an open source robot! Anyone who loves to understand the robot from the mechanical frame to firmware will be welcome. You can even re-program the robot with Arduino code to start a new way to draw.
